    "Whenever we deal with a $$\omega$$𝜔<sub>1</sub> dataset to solve a particular problem, it is helpful to first analyze the data and extract some information. In this exercise, we are going to take a look at statistical measures which are very basic tools and describe the data by a single number only. However, this does not mean that they are useless or less important than other (more complex) analysis. Every measure conveys a special meaning and must be applied with care since they are also easily misinterpreted.\n",

    "    b) The other labels may deserve a bit of explanation. Unfortunately, it is not strictly defined how the whiskers (4 and 5) are set and what is treated as an outlier (7). The general idea is to show the relevant range of the data via the whiskers and all other data points, where the evidence is strong that they don’t really belong to the dataset, are considered as outliers. Toolkits and libraries usually provide a way to configure this behavior. However, there is a common convention for the whiskers which says that they are set to at most 1.5 times of the interquartile range. “most” because we adjust the whiskers to represent a value which is actually present in the dataset. Every data value which still lies outside this range is considered an outlier.\n",
