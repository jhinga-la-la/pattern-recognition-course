    "1. First, we want to get used to 𝑠<sub>𝑋 𝑌</sub> by calculating its value for a simple two-dimensional dataset given above. The centre of mass is (̄𝑥, ̄𝑦) = (1.5, 2). Use Figure 1 to calculate the value of 𝑠<sub>𝑋 𝑌</sub> via the following steps:\n",

    "    a) Draw the four quadrants separated by the centre of mass and axes-aligned lines.![](./img/figure1.png)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b) Mark for each quadrant in which way it influences the covariance, i.e. if it increases or decreases its value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c) Draw a rectangle for each data point.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d) Calculate the covariance by weighting each rectangle (positively or negatively) corresponding to the quadrant, summing up and applying the overall scaling factor 1/𝑛−1. Note how you essentially calculated Equation 1 with these steps.\n",

Consider now the new dataset shown in Figure 2 where a rectangle is drawn for each data point with the colour corresponding to the sign of the quadrant. We now want to see what influences the magnitude of 𝑠<sub>𝑋 𝑌</sub>. \n",
    "\n",
    "    a) One important factor is the fraction of positively and negatively weighted points, i.e. the intensity of the red and green areas compared. Add a new data point to one of the areas so that 𝑠<sub>𝑋 𝑌</sub> increases.\n",
    "    b) Add yet another point to the dataset which also increases 𝑠<sub>𝑋 𝑌</sub> but with a higher amount than before.\n",
    "    c) Currently, the two variables have a similar scaling (the axis range is the same in both cases). But, if the scales were not the same, would it influence 𝑠<sub>𝑋 𝑌</sub> ? Suppose e.g. that 𝑋 is currently measured in metre and if we changed that to kilometre, would this influence the magnitude of 𝑠<sub>𝑋 𝑌</sub> ?"
